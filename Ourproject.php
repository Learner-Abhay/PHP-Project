      <img src="blog1.jpg">
    </div>
            <p>A word from Gojou and the remnant of the real Getou's soul still within his body starts to choke the person currently controlling the rest of his body, Fake Getou is impressed, but is able to regain control. The Prison Domain closes around Gojou and shrinks to slightly larger than a Rubik's Cube. Unless Gojou kills himself (fat chance) the Domain is unusable as it only holds one.<br>One of now-dead Muta Koukichi's "Insurance" devices drops into Yuuji's ear and reports that the device would only be activated if Gojou is sealed. Mei Mei is initially skeptical, but Koukichi manages to convince her. She sends Yuuji out to warn the other sorcerers, holding off two high-grade cursed spirits closing on their position. Meanwhile, the three standby teams start to head into the first veil. </p>
 
            <h2 class="con-heading">CARDIO ZONE</h2>
    <div class=box1>
      <img src="blog2.jpg">
    </div>

            <p>
            A pair of special grade cursed spirits roam Shibuya with the goal of killing all the assistant supervisors, i.e. suits. Yuuji emerges from the Veil, sees a horde of transfigured humans, and makes quick work of them, saving a handful of non-sorcerers.<br>He then climbs to one of the highest points in the district and shouts out a warning to everyone at the top of his lungs: Gojou has been sealed. As soon as Nanami hears this, he switches up the plan: he, Ino and Megumi will rendezvous with Yuuji.</p>

            <h2 class="con-heading">STRENGTH</h2>
    <div class=box1>
      <img src="blog3.jpg" >
    </div>
    <p>
    As the Prison Domain processes all of the information that comprises Gojou Satoru, the cube is rendered too heavy to hold or move, making it vulnerable. Thanks to another Mechamaru device in the station, Koukichi is able to tell Yuuji that Gojou is immobileâ€¦but that likely won't remain so for long.<br>Getou has to stay with the cube, so Mahito, Jougo and Choso all head out with one goal: kill Yuuji. Of the three of them, only Jougo wants to awaken Sukuna; the others just want to kill him. There's also the matter of Mimiko and Nanako asking the Fake Getou to release his body, something he tells them he's not going to do; he made a promise to them, not a binding pact.<br>Team Nanami meets up with Yuuji, and Nanami leaves Yuuji and Magumi in Ino Takuma's care. Ino lays out the stakes: if Gojou dies, not only will the Gojou clan die with him, creating a massive political free-for-all, but the balance of power between sorcerers and curses will be upset, meaning the age of humans in Japan will be over.<br>One would hope Japan wouldn't have to rely on one goddamn person to maintain its existence, but here we are. It's up to Yuuji, Megumi, Nobara, and all the other sorcerers stationed there to rescue Gojou from the Prison Realm, or die trying.</p>
